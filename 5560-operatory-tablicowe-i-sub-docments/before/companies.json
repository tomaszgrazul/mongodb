On Jamendo, thousands of independent artists authorise the sharing of their music. It's free, legal and unlimited.\r\nJamendo is also a community of artists and music lovers who share their passion, recommend music, create playlists and make Jamendo a benchmark destination for discovering new talent.\r\n\"It's a symbolic figure of course, but it demonstrates the success of this new model for online music promotion that Jamendo has supported from the start and that is made possible by the considerable flexibility of the Creative Commons licences\", commented Laurent Kratz, cofounder and CEO. \"We feel certain that the growth potential is huge. A simple illustration of that is the amazing creativity and talent of the thousands of artists who choose to share their music on Jamendo.\"\r\n\r\nA few figures about Jamendo:\r\n- Over 2 million unique visitors per month\r\n- 500 000 tracks downloaded daily\r\n- 350 000 registered members, including over 5000 artists and bands\r\n- 150 000 tracks and... 10 000 albums!\r\n\r\n- The upward trend is exponential: currently nearly 300 new albums are posted on Jamendo every week.\r\n\r\nOne example: Rob Costlow, an American pianist whose instrumental albums are among the most popular on Jamendo, has gathered a record 425 000 combined listens.\r\nJamendo has also launched a brand new feature for its artists and users: the widgets. In a few clicks, anyone can now embed on their blog or website a player featuring any given album or playlist from the Jamendo catalog.\r\nThe Jamendo team has selected for you a few tracks, featuring a sample of the best rock, hip hop, electro, reggae and jazz you can find on Jamendo, that we encourage you to download and share!\r\n\r\nAbout Jamendo\r\nJamendo is the\r\nfirst global platform for free and legal music downloads. Available in six languages, the website offers the world's widest free music catalog: 150 000 tracks by over 5000 artists from around the world. Jamendo's innovative business model allows free-of-cost downloads for visitors and income for artists, based on the splitting of revenue from advertising and commercial uses. For artists, it is also a great promotional platform. Launched in 2005 by Sylvain Zimmer, Laurent Kratz and Pierre GÃ©rard, Jamendo is now led by an international team of over 20 people based in Luxemburg.\r\n\r\n","source_description":" theums available for free download.","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Jamendo","permalink":"jamendo"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}

Businesses can hire these online freelancers for any type of work that can be done in front of a computer — from every tech skill imaginable to project management, customer support, marketing, design and even legal services. Access to a large, global pool of skilled contractors is especially powerful for startups and small businesses with limited resources, businesses seeking a very specific skill that’s difficult to find within commuting distance, and businesses located outside a metropolitan area. oDesk&#8217;s unique model provides transparency and protection for both the business and the worker, guaranteeing and tracking that an hour paid is an hour worked. </p>\n\n<p>oDesk is primarily funded by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/benchmark-capital\" title=\"Benchmark

On MeeVee, you select from a list of favorite actors, genres, subjects, or enter keyword interests (e.g. &#8220;golf&#8221;). The guide then finds upcoming programming based on those interests. It&#8217;s a saved search so it&#8217;ll keep looking for those programs for you until you remove the interests. If you love &#8220;Jennifer Aniston&#8221;, you can add her as a favorite actress or keyword and, until you delete her, all shows or movies on TV with Jennifer Aniston showing through your cable or satellite provider will populate your guide. If you are willing to invest the time, you can build a totally customized TV guide and ditch the universal grid completely. It&#8217;s an easy-to-use application and it&#8217;s a nice model for building a personalized web experience. The TV listings widget (called &#8220;MeeVee Guide&#8221;) they&#8217;ve built shows your personal guide to visitors of your pages on other sites. You can add to a page by pasting a snippet of code to it.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"68"}],"assets/images/resized/0000/1960/1960v1-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"176"},{"$numberInt":"80"}],"assets/images/resized/0000/1960/1960v1-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"176"},{"$numberInt":"80"}],"assets/images/resized/0000/1960/1960v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"MeeVee","permalink":"meevee"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"Aaron","permalink":"ian-aaron"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board

Spinvox started with their (now patented) Voice Message Conversion System in 2005, becoming one of the first companies to convert voicemails to text messages for both landlines and mobile telephones. Users subscribed to the service have incoming voicemail converted and sent as text messages to their mobile phone or emails in their inbox.</p>\n\n<p>In order to compete with other similar service providers, Spinvox has recently introduced some other features such as SpinVox Blog; it allows users speak a post to a blog from any phone. There is also the Memo service: users speak memos to themselves &#8211; the messages subsequently get transcribed and sent as email reminders.

Skype announce the availability of voicemail\r\nto text conversion for all Skype voicemail users today. SpinVox\r\nconveniently converts voice messages to text in English, Spanish, French and\r\nGerman. The messages are then sent by Skype as an SMS text directly to a\r\ndesignated mobile phone for users to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkype users can now benefit from instant â€˜visible voicemailâ€™, and never miss\r\nthose important calls from friends or colleagues when they are away from\r\nSkype. Recipients of converted voicemail messages can listen to the full\r\nvoice message by either signing into Skype or by calling their Skype To Go\r\nnumber[1] <#11fccd15ca3c9e17__ftn1>. As well as being able to receive\r\nvoicemail as text via SpinVox, Skype users may choose instead to receive\r\nvoicemail notification via SMS or for free by email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œSkype is the first internet communications software provider to deploy\r\nSpinVox, further reinforcing our position as the only provider of voice to\r\ntext messaging services which are used daily by millions of people on five\r\ncontinents,â€ says SpinVox co-founder and CEO, Christina Domecq. â€œOur user\r\nbase has grown over twenty-fold in the last 12 months and bringing Skypeâ€™s\r\nvoicemail subscribers on board will accelerate this trend.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œUsing SpinVox gives our users added flexibility and convenience over their\r\nSkype voicemails, said Mike Bartlett, director of product strategy at Skype.\r\nâ€œAs people continue to spend more time on the move and on their mobile\r\ndevices, people want to take their Skype conversations with them. SpinVox\r\nis a great option for our users to save time on checking their Skype\r\nvoicemail and receive messages immediately sent to their mobile phone.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItâ€™s easy for Skype users to set up voicemail to text from their account\r\npage, by simply registering a mobile phone number. Each voicemail to text\r\nconversion will cost $0.25 plus the cost of sending an SMS at standard low\r\nSkype rates. Additional SMS charges â€“ a maximum of 3 - may apply depending\r\non the length of the voicemail message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll payments are made fuss-free through Skype Credit. Users have a choice\r\nto set a limit on the number of voicemail conversions received per day and\r\nto receive messages from people only in their contact list to help them\r\nmanage their Skype credit. An email notification will be sent if that limit\r\nis exceeded.

Founded in 1999, Cyworld was bought in 2003 by SK Telecom, Korea&#8217;s primary provider of mobile telecommunications.  Since then Cyworld has experienced rapid growth, becoming a social networking phenomenon in South Korea.  In fact, Cyworld has claimed more than one third of Korea&#8217;s entire population as members, while achieving incredible penetration of Korea&#8217;s young adult market: 90% of Koreans in their 20s are members of Cyworld.</p>\n\n<p>Cyworld - US version - lets users sign up and create their own profile (called a Minihome in Cyworld) and their own avatar (Minime) for free.  You can then personalize your avatar, design a Miniroom, meet new people, stay in touch with friends, send messages, upload photos, exchange gifts, and more.  Essentially, Cyworld allows users to create their own personalized cyber-lives through which they can live vicariously, express themselves, and connect with friends.</p>\n\n<p>The company has recently expanded its social networking site to other countries including China, Taiwan, Japan, and now the US.  It is sure to face steep competition from US social networking giants <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a> and <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>, and will face difficulty luring away US users who have been long-entrenched in their familiar social networks.

This new offering, which puts the power of muvee's patented technology in the hands of Cyworld's more than 20 million users, allows consumers to add music and unique styles to their videos and photos and create emotionally engaging muvees to share with their online friends and family. Cyworld users will ultimately have access to hundreds of online editing styles, which they can use with Cyworld credits called dotoris to automatically create muvees and then easily display on their mini Hompy (Home Pages).\r\n\r\n\"Years before the term 'Web 2.0' was coined in the West, Korea had already been at the forefront of what we now call social media and virtual worlds,\" said Terence Swee, CEO of muvee. \"muvee is proud to be Cyworld's chosen platform provider for a service that can both satisfy the ease of use and interactivity demands of discerning Korean internet consumers, and match the scale of Cyworld's service level requirements. This partnership is a strategic addition to our internet business, which complements global partners we have in the PC and mobile space.\"\r\n\r\nmuvee's goal is to help people to relive and share their special moments -- the planned, the unexpected, and everything in between. While Cyworld members can already share their personal media in its original form, they now have the opportunity to create something fun and new that will add an exciting twist and change the way they can express themselves.\r\n\r\nA recent study by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OEDC) found that South Korea has the world's highest household broadband penetration. South Korea is also known to have the most advanced mobile cellular network in the world. This has helped the South Korean population to become the most advanced consumers of social networking services both online and on mobile wireless networks.\r\n\r\nThe muvee making service is available today at www.cyworld.com.\r\n\r\nAbout muvee\r\nmuvee's software and services feature patented technology that lets people create and share professional-quality instant home movies out of unedited video, digital pictures and music. muvee develops consumer products for a range of platforms and devices including PCs, digital cameras, mobile phones and photo kiosks. muvee's global customers include HP, Dell, Nokia, LG, Sony, Olympus, Nikon and Creative Technology.

September 10, 2008 â€“ ScanScout, the leading network for in-stream video advertising, announced today that Bill Day has joined the company as Chief Executive Officer.  Waikit Lau, ScanScoutâ€™s Co-Founder and acting CEO, returns to his role as President of the company.\r\n\r\nA digital media industry veteran, as well as one of the most recognized executives in the web media space; Mr. Day is one of the co-founders and was CEO of About.com.  Most recently he served as Chief Media Officer of the global search engine marketing firm Marchex (NSDQ: MCHX).  Mr. Dayâ€™s digital media experience ranges back to his role as CEO of MeMedia, (formerly WhenU) the behavioral targeting firm and as a senior member of the Prodigy team, responsible for building many of the online services we find common today.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur Board of Directors, co-founder and CTO Steven Lee, and I have spent a lot of time interviewing candidates and meeting specifically with Bill during this process.  His perceptiveness and deep knowledge of our ecosystem combined with his proven leadership abilities and experience make him a natural choice as CEO.â€ said Mr. Lau.  â€œPeople may not be aware that while at About.com, Bill actually started another company called Sprinks â€“ an extremely hi-performing ad network that was eventually acquired by Google.  This is testament to not just his energy but also to his understanding and breadth of experience in our industry.   Weâ€™re extremely pleased to name him CEO of ScanScout.â€\r\n\r\n\"ScanScoutâ€™s technology is the draw here, not just for what they alone can do for advertisers and publishers today, but for how they have already thought ahead to the future and where targeting and video delivery are going across multiple platforms,\" said Mr. Day. \"I see the kind of forward thinking at ScanScout that enabled About.com and Marchex to succeed.  In every case, the value resides in how the companyâ€™s technology solves problems now and anticipates them in the future.  At the same time, our network is extremely well-positioned to continue its growth and to scale our business well beyond the more than 200M streams weâ€™re currently delivering every month.\"\r\nAbout ScanScout\r\n\r\nScanScout is the market-leading online video advertising network.

Users can even use their own domain names for these galleries. SmugMug still has the more typical Web 2.0 photo sharing features like RSS feeds, tags, and a public API. More recently, SmugMug has added functionality to automatically scale the size of photos to the viewing size of the browser.

features include specific categorization of available Wi-Fi hotspots, user-friendly mapping of all access points relative to a specific street address, and more\r\n\r\nUsers are able to locate and connect automatically to the best available hotspots, which are qualified by the user community, utilizing an expanding database of over 56 million Wi-Fi access points worldwide\r\n\r\nDelaware, USA, April 14, 2010: WeFi Inc. (www.wefi.com), creator of the worldâ€™s largest community-based global Wi-Fi network, launched today an enhanced version of its free software for PC and Android mobile devices. The software, available for free download from www.wefi.com/download/, provides users with automatic access to the best Wi-Fi connection available. WeFiâ€™s updated software utilizes crowdsourcing to drive backend algorithms that provide for superior Wi-Fi intelligence on all details relating to nearby hotspots, enabling a more comprehensive user experience. The enhanced features are further proof of WeFi leading the way in providing quick and automatic Wi-Fi access to users around the world.\r\n\r\nPrime features of the updated version of the software include up-to-date, highly detailed information of available hotspots such as the type of location (cafÃ©, library, etc.), whether or not the Wi-Fi access point requires a password, costs money or is free, requires a web homepage sign-in or not, and more. A new â€œFind Wi-Fiâ€ feature enables users to locate qualified hotspots either around their current location â€“ not only within the Wi-Fi reception range of their device, but on the streets around them â€“ or around any desired street address. While Android users will benefit from WeFi using GPS or cell-based location technology to automatically identify nearby hotspots around their current location, users on both PC and Android can also take advantage of â€œFind Wi-Fiâ€ by typing in any desired address (see screenshots for example). A look at the WeFi global map of recorded hotspots â€“ over 56 million to date worldwide â€“ enables WeFiâ€™s more than 4 million users to find hotspots around the globe, locate fellow users online based on their connection location, and map and edit updated information on hotspots near them as well. Users can have their Twitter status automatically updated with a change in WeFi location as well.\r\n\r\nThe WeFi software provides a high performance, open and global broadband wireless network by combining a community-generated database, a smart connection manager and a dynamic access point/hotspot directory. WeFi always seeks to connect users to Wi-Fi access points where the Internet access has already been verified by other WeFi-enabled devices â€“ dubbed â€œcommunity-verified spotsâ€ â€“ and has a growing network of over 56 million â€œverifiedâ€ access points.\r\n\r\nZur Feldman, CEO of WeFi, said:\r\nâ€œMore and more each day, the ability to connect to the Internet quickly and easily is becoming a crucial tool needed to stay informed and interact with friends, family and business partners. The beauty of what WeFi provides to its users is the high-level intelligence that allows them to locate, connect to, and stay connected to the fastest available Wi-Fi hotspot around, no matter where they are. Our newly enhanced software provides a number of upgraded features that gives the user an even greater awareness and control of where and when they want to connect, and serves as further proof of WeFiâ€™s commitment to providing the best Wi-Fi internet experience possible.â€","source_description":"Enhanced WeFi Version Launches on Android Mobile Phones, Bringing Superior Wi-Fi Intelligence  ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"WeFi","permalink":"wefi"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"94"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/3553/43553v1-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"250"},{"$numberInt":"156"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/3553/43553v1-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"450"},{"$numberInt":"282"}],"assets/images/resized/0004/3553/43553v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[]}

As many Digg clones and alternative models are failing or have failed to take hold of a substantial user base, Thoof brings a slightly new take on getting your daily stories which it hopes will attract more than a niche audience.  Thoof is an automated news recommender of sorts.  It works similarly to many music recommendation engines such as <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/last.fm\" title=\"Last.fm\">Last.fm</a> and <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/pandora\" title=\"Pandora\">Pandora</a>, by displaying articles you might like based upon your past reading history.  Readers submit articles in a Digg-like fashion, but don&#8217;t vote to get the articles on the front page.  Founder Ian Clarke, formerly of video site <a href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/revver\" title=\"Revver\">Revver</a>, claims that with video as well as news, many people may read articles but few will vote on them.  Clarke hints that the passivity of news and video consumption may ultimately weed out news aggregators that cannot automatically deliver customized news.

With the proliferation of mobile video, iPods, Tivo and other Internet-connected set-top-boxes, Revision3 believes that tailored, on-demand video will continue to increase in importance versus traditional broadcast content developed for very broad audiences.  Revision3 video content focuses on technology, comedy, music, cooking, and other niche subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Revision3 attempts to be agnostic about how its content gets distributed. The company works with multiple distribution platforms, including iTunes, Odeo, Bittorrent, and Palm.  Revision3 also supports multiple video encoding formats, including flash, to help make content broadly accessible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"150"},{"$numberInt":"40"}],"assets/images/resized/0000/0955/955v1-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"180"},{"$numberInt":"49"}],"assets/images/resized/0000/0955/955v1-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"180"},{"$numberInt":"49"}],"assets/images/resized/0000/0955/955v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Revision3","permalink":"revision3"},{"name":"Best

It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz\" title=\"Dustin Moskovitz\">Dustin Moskovitz</a>, <a href=\"/person/chris-hughes\" title=\"Chris Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris Hughes</a>, and <a href=\"/person/eduardo-saverin\" title=\"Eduardo Saverin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eduardo Saverin</a> to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. </p>\n\n<p>The original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg&#8217;s high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.</p>\n\n<p>With this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to <a href=\"/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto\" title=\"Palo Alto\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palo Alto</a> for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of <a href=\"/company/napster\" title=\"Napster\" rel=\"nofollow\">Napster</a>, <a href=\"/person/sean-parker\" title=\"Sean Parker\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sean Parker</a>. Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg&#8217;s apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, <a href=\"/person/peter-thiel\" title=\"Peter Thiel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Thiel</a>, cofounder of <a href=\"/company/paypal\" title=\"PayPal\" rel=\"nofollow\">PayPal</a> and managing partner of <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund\" title=\"The Founders Fund\">The Founders Fund</a>. Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. </p>\n\n<p>With millions more users, <a href=\"/company/friendster\" title=\"Friendster\" rel=\"nofollow\">Friendster</a> <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/\" title=\"attempted\">attempted</a> to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners\" title=\"Accel Partners\">Accel Partners</a>, at a valuation of <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/\" title=\"around $100 million\">around $100 million</a>. Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock\" title=\"Greylock Partners\">Greylock Partners</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners\" title=\"Meritech Capital\">Meritech Capital</a>, as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/\" title=\"opened\">opened</a> up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/\" title=\"opened\">opened</a> to anyone with an email address. </p>\n\n<p>In the summer of 2006, <a href=\"/company/yahoo\" title=\"Yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yahoo</a> <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/\" title=\"attempted to acquire\">attempted to acquire</a> the company for $1 billion dollars. <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook\" title=\"Reports\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reports</a> actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo&#8217;s stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/\" title=\"offered\">offered</a> $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the &#8220;kid&#8221; who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; <a href=\"/company/viacom\" title=\"Viacom\" rel=\"nofollow\">Viacom</a> had previously <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/\" title=\"unsuccessfully\">unsuccessfully</a> attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. </p>\n\n<p>Not long after, in October 2007, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/\" title=\"Microsoft invested\">Microsoft invested</a> $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/\" title=\"5th most valuable US Internet company\">5th most valuable US Internet company</a>, yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft&#8217;s decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/\" title=\"$1.5 billion round\">$1.5 billion round</a>, valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/\" title=\"announced\">announced</a> that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/\" title=\"$42.05\">$42.05</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One sour note for Facebook has been the <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/\" title=\"controversy\">controversy</a> with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/\" title=\"gone to court\">gone to court</a>, and has now been <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/\" title=\"resolved\">resolved</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook&#8217;s growth has been staggering. Facebook announced <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/\" title=\"astonishing numbers\">astonishing numbers</a> in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/\" title=\"1.15 billion\">1.15 billion</a> users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook&#8217;s user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/\" title=\"most trafficked sites\">most trafficked sites</a> in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook users&#8217; <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/\" title=\"passion\">passion</a>—or <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/\" title=\"addiction\">addiction</a>—to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site&#8217;s popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled <em>The Social Network</em> was released which chronicled Facebook&#8217;s inception.</p>\n\n<p>In its 2012 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/\" title=\"IPO filing\">IPO filing</a>, Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and

At\r\nan event held in Mountain View, Calif., Bebo demoed new metrics and\r\nengagement tools to nearly 100 Java, PHP, and Rails developers who have\r\ncreated applications - from music and movies to gameplay and photo\r\nsharing - for the siteâ€™s 45 million users worldwide. Bebo has also\r\nannounced JavaScript support in Beta for platform developers.\r\n\r\nBeboâ€™s industry-first developer tools include new, valuable engagement\r\nmetrics and reporting that analyze time spent, percentage of returning\r\nusers, and time spent/total installs of applications. Bebo will use a\r\nportion of this newly available information to compute an Engagement\r\nMetric for developers, based on both percentage of returning users and\r\ntime spent in an application. All applications will be given a dynamic\r\n1-10 ranking, and those that consistently hold the highest ranking will\r\nbe rewarded with increased access to viral channels and visibility,\r\nopportunity to test Beta features. The first reward will be the ability\r\nto send changes feed items to non-app users.\r\n\r\nTo underscore its commitment to engaging applications, Bebo also\r\nannounced today the B.E.S.T â€œBeboâ€™s Engage to Succeed Todayâ€ Developer\r\nChallenge\r\nfor\r\nnew applications, with co-sponsor Sun Startup Essentials. Judges for\r\nBeboâ€™s B.E.S.T. contest are bloggers Dave McClure of 500Hats, Frank\r\nGruber of SomewhatFrank.com, and Jesse Stay of StayNAlive. The contest\r\nis open to all new applications uploaded to Bebo beginning today.\r\nWinners will be announced at a future Bebo developer event in early\r\n2009, and will win prizes from Sun Microsystems and on-site promotion on\r\nBebo.\r\n\r\nâ€œBeboâ€™s Open Application Platform has allowed developers of all sizes to\r\nbuild engaging applications for Beboâ€™s international user base since its\r\nlaunch nearly one year ago,â€ said Jessica Alter, Director of Business\r\nDevelopment and Platform for Bebo. â€œAt Bebo, we pride ourselves on\r\nhaving an extremely active and engaged community. Now with the addition\r\nof new engagement metrics and tools, we are providing developers with\r\nbetter information and a tangible measure of engagement so that they can\r\nincrease the performance of their apps, and maximize revenues. This adds\r\ngreat value to the overall platform, and really gives developers the\r\ntools they need to build applications that users will want to come back to.â€\r\n\r\nToday, developers joined Bebo engineers to hear firsthand how Beboâ€™s\r\napplication platform was built, and learned about â€œPlatform Migrationâ€\r\nfrom Blake Commagere of Ohai, deployment on OpenSolaris from Marina\r\nFisher from the Sun Startup Essentials Team, and demos from five other\r\napplication developers.\r\n\r\nSun Startup Essentials is offering free web hosting for Bebo developers\r\nfor one year on Joyent's cloud computing environment. To sign up and get\r\nfree access the developers can go to\r\nhttp://www.joyent.com/developers/bebo. With this offer, developers can\r\nleverage the feature set of OpenSolaris to develop, debug and deploy\r\nBebo social applications and scale from zero to millions of pages views.\r\n\r\nâ€œSun Microsystems is a strong supporter of the developer communities and\r\ninitiatives that encourage innovation through the use of open source\r\napplications and platforms,â€ said Sanjay Sharma, Director of Startups\r\nand Emerging Markets at Sun Microsystems. â€œWe are excited to co-sponsor\r\nthe B.E.S.T contest and to collaborate with Bebo and Joyent to provide\r\nBebo developers access to Sunâ€™s OpenSolaris platform and expertise in\r\nbuilding large scale applications.â€\r\n\r\nLaunched in December 2007, Beboâ€™s Open Application Platform allows third\r\nparty developers to integrate their applications directly with the Bebo\r\nsite.

It has since evolved into a major internet brand with search, content verticals, and other web services.</p>\n\n<p>Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo!), incorporated in 1995, is a global Internet brand. To users, the Company provides owned and operated online properties and services (Yahoo! Properties, Offerings, or Owned and Operated sites). Yahoo! also extends its marketing platform and access to Internet users beyond Yahoo! Properties through its distribution network of third-party entities (referred to as Affiliates) who have integrated its advertising offerings into their Websites (referred to as Affiliate sites) or their other offerings. To advertisers and publishers, it provides a range of marketing solutions and tools that enable businesses to reach users who visit Yahoo! Properties and its Affiliate sites. To developers, the Company provides an array of Web services and application programming interfaces (APIs), technical resources, tools, and channels to market. </p>\n\n<p>The Company&#8217;s offerings to users fall into five categories: Front Doors; Search; Communications and Communities; Media, and Connected Life. The majority of its offerings are available in more than 20 languages. Yahoo! generates revenues by providing marketing services to advertisers across a majority of Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites. Additionally, although many of its user services are free, Yahoo! does charge for a range of premium services that it offers.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[{"$numberInt":"142"},{"$numberInt":"37"}],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v12-max-150x150.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"142"},{"$numberInt":"37"}],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v12-max-250x250.png"],[[{"$numberInt":"142"},{"$numberInt":"37"}],"assets/images/resized/0001/0836/10836v12-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Yahoo.com","permalink":"yahoo-com"},{"name":"Yahoo!

YORK (Reuters) - CBS Corp said on Wednesday it reached a deal to allow its Web videos to be carried by Yahoo Inc, part of a broader plan by the media company to add new outlets for its television shows.\r\n\r\nThe deal would have Yahoo join the CBS Audience Network, which already includes major outlets like Google Inc's YouTube, Time Warner Inc's AOL and Microsoft Corp's MSN, as well as sites like Joost, Veoh, and Bebo.\r\n\r\nThe Audience Network offers short-form clips from CBS, CSTV and Showtime, and before the inclusion of Yahoo reached nearly 90 percent of the Web. The clips are advertising-supported and free to consumers.\r\n\r\nCBS has maintained that it prefers to make its content available in as many places as possible, unlike competitors such as NBC Universal, which has tighter restrictions on where its entertainment is distributed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Electric Co's NBC Universal and News Corp have teamed together to launch website Hulu, which carries a range of TV and movie clips.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, CBS has stopped short of joining that site, pursuing a host of other deals with its Audience Network.\r\n\r\n(Reporting by Paul Thomasch, editing by Gerald E.

YORK, January 31, 2008 - KickApps, the leading on demand social media platform, today announced version 3.0 of its SaaS application suite.  KickApps Version 3.0 makes it easier than ever for web publishers and developers of all levels and experience to deploy Social Networking, User Generated Content (UGC), Programmable Video Players and Widgets.  In addition, the new release dramatically extends a web publisher's ability to manage media, members and reporting-all essential elements to growing a successful online community.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the KickApps API Developer Kit provides access to the entire KickApps platform for deeper levels of integration and customization.   With 3.0, web publishers now have complete control of their KickApps deployment.  The Developer Kit offers robust and secure API's that enable custom workflow and tight integration with a publisher's existing content and third-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum, KickApps 3.0 opens community creation to a wide range of non-technical web publishers.  A powerful new WYSIWYG site creation and deployment interface allows web publishers with minimal technical knowledge the ability to build and customize social media websites and widgets with just a few clicks.  These point-and-click features also help experienced web developers achieve rapid prototyping and fast deployment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, KickApps 3.0 includes an array of community experiences that focus on driving member engagement and viral growth:  community news feeds, social graphs, one-click media syndication, media-enabled message boards and customized group features.\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful enhancements is the KickApps 3.0 Affiliate Center.

Members of KickApps powered sites can now engage in live text and audio/video conversations with each other.\r\n\r\n\"Chat and IM are great ways for members of online communities to grow their relationships with people that share similar interests,\" said Alex Blum, CEO of KickApps. \"Many of our publishing partners have seen tremendous growth as a result of implementing social media features like blogging, commenting and photo & video sharing, and adding Userplane will give them the ability to offer immediate communication between their members. We expect these types of integrations of external applications from 3rd party developers to drive even greater levels of engagement that fuel their websites' growth.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this agreement, KickApps has integrated Userplane Webchat and Userplane Webmessenger as core features of the KickApps Platform, available on a self-service basis. KickApps customers, known as affiliates, can activate the chat and IM functionality by simply selecting an option in the KickApps Affiliate Center, the web-based console for managing KickApps-powered communities. When chat and IM are activated, a \"Chat\" tab will appear in the default top navigation of a KickApps-powered site and a \"Send an instant message\" link will appear on all member profile pages if the member is logged into the community. As with all KickApps applications, affiliates are able to customize how chat is deployed by altering their site's HTML and CSS code, or by using JavaScript.\r\n\r\n\"IM and chat are some of the earliest building blocks of social networking,\" said Michael Jones, CEO of Userplane. \"The integration of Userplane into the KickApps\" Platform will create new opportunities for growth and revenue for KickApps' customers, KickApps and Userplane. Working with KicKApps we look forward to helping web publishers of all sizes get the most out of their social media sites.\"\r\n\r\nThe chat and IM features are available at no additional cost with the placement of non-intrusive, relevant advertising on the chat and IM clients by Userplane. KickApps affiliates that wish to control or remove the advertising positions in the chat and IM experiences can do so through an advertising buyout directly with Userplane.\r\nAbout Userplane\r\nA wholly owned subsidiary of AOL, Userplane is the world's premier social software provider for online communities and operates one of the largest social media ad network globally. The company's hosted apps enable instant community and communication for websites of any scale and audience — and support millions of users daily. Userplane's social ad network offers a revenue-sharing solution that serves up half a billion daily impressions atop social websites reaching nearly 50M users monthly. Founded in 2001 by long-time partners Michael Jones, Nate Thelen, and Javier Hall, Userplane -- one of the pioneers of the social web -- is based in Santa Monica, Calif.\r\n\r\nAbout KickApps\r\n\r\nKickApps provides on-demand social media applications that enable web publishers and marketers to grow, engage and monetize online audiences.

The company took a big risk in 2006 when they gave users the ability to auto-insert slide shows into their MySpace pages and blasting bulletins out to all their friends. They did this by asking users to hand over their MySpace credentials, and doing all the hard work for them. This is a clear violation of MySpace&#8217;s terms of service, though, and most people expected Slide to receive a cease and desist letter and/or get access turned off. But that never happened, and Slide&#8217;s big bet has paid off.  Slide has since evolved to offer a number of widgets.
